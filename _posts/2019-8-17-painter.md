In this article, we will be using data from the Web Gallery of Art, a virtual museum and searchable database of European fine arts from the $$ 3^{rd} $$ to $$ 19^{th} $$ centuries. The gallery can be accessed  [here](https://www.wga.hu/index1.html).

We will create an algorithm to predict the name of the painter based on an intial set of features of the painting, and then gradually including more and more, thus improving the feature engineering, and including pictures.

Through this article, we will illustrate:
- The importance of good feature engineering;
- The importance of data enrichment; and
- The impact this can have on accuracy
