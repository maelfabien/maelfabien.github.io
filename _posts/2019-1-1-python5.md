Around 85% of the world data is unstructured, and a good part of it is text data. As a data analyst or data scientist, it is a common job to handle text data, and therfore strings.

# Character Strings

Character strings are sequences of individual letters which all together form a string.

```python
a = "My cat is 8"
```

Now, we'll dive into some key functions that you can use on strings.

You can retrieve the length of a string by simply using the keyword `len` :

```python
len(a)
```

```
11
``

You can count the number of occurences of a specific letter by using `.count`:

```python
a.count("M")
```

```
1
```

You can apply a lower, upper or title transformation to a string (`upper`, `lower`, `title`).

```python
a.upper()
```

```
MY CAT IS 8
```

You can replace a letter or several letters by another letter or group of letters.

```python
a.replace("My", "my")
```

```
my cat is 8
```

What if I now want to split my string into a list of words, that is to obtain a list of words? You can use the `split` keyword:

```python
a.split()
```

```
["My", "cat", "is", "8"]
```

You can specify in the parenthesis the character on which it should split, by default it is the space.

You can also index a string to extract a sub-string:

```python
a[1:6]
```

```
y cat
```

We start the indexing in 0, and exclude the 6th element. Notice how the space counts as a character too.
