Let's continue our work on image alignment. We shall cover further details on image warping.

For what comes next, we'll work a bit in Python. Import the following packages :

```python
import cv2
import numpy as np
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
```

So far, we saw how to :
- detect features (Harris corner detector, Laplacian of Gaussians for blobs, difference of Gaussians for fast approximation of the LOG)
- the properties of the ideal feature
- the properties of the feature descriptor
- matching of local features
- feature distance metrics

We'll cover into further details image alignment.

# I. Image Warping

There is a geometric relationship between these 2 images :

![image](https://maelfabien.github.io/assets/images/vision_48.jpg)

An image warping is a change of domain of an image : $$ g(x) = f(h(x)) $$. This might include translation, rotation or aspect change. These changes are said to be global parametric warping: $$ p' = T(p) $$, since the transformation can easily be described by few parameters and is the same for every input point.

To build the transformed image, we usually apply an inverse-warping :
- for every pixel $$ x' $$ in $$ g(x') $$ :
- compute the source location $$ x = \hat{h}(x') $$
- resample $$ f(x) $$ at location $$ x $$ and copy to $$ g(x') $$

This allows $$ \hat{h}(x') $$ to be defined for all pixels in $$ g(x') $$.

## 1. Linear transformations

We'll now cover the different types of linear transformations that we can apply to an image using inverse-warping.

### a. Uniform Scaling

Scaling by factor $$ s $$ :

$$ S =  \begin{pmatrix} s & 0 \\ 0 & s \end{pmatrix} $$

### b. Rotation

Rotation by angle $$ \theta $$ :

$$ R =  \begin{pmatrix} cos \theta & - sin \theta \\ sin \theta & cos \theta \end{pmatrix} $$

### c. 2D Mirror about the Y-axis

$$ T =  \begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix} $$

### d. 2D Miror accross line $$ y = x $$

$$ T =  \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix} $$

### e. All 2D linear transformations

In summary, the linear transforms we can apply are :
- scale
- rotation
- shear
- mirror

$$  \begin{pmatrix} x' \\ y \end{pmatrix} =  \begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix}  \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} $$

The transformation should respect the following properties :
- origin maps origin
- lines map to lines
- parallel lines remain parallel
- ratios are preserved
- closed under composition

## 2. Translation

The trick is to add one more coordinate to build homogenous image coordinates.

## 3. Affine transformation

An affine transformation is any transformation that combines linear transformations and translations. For example :

$$ \begin{pmatrix} x' \\ y' \\ w' \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} a & b & c \\ d & e & f \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \\ w \end{pmatrix} $$

In affine transformations, the origin does not always have to map the origin.

## 4. Homography

The Homography transform is also called projective transformation or planar perspective map.

$$ H = \begin{pmatrix} a & b & c \\ d & e & f \\ g & h & 1 \end{pmatrix} $$

Homographic transformations simply respect the following properties :
- lines map to lines
- closed under composition

The different transformations can be summarized this way :

With homographies, points at infinity become finite vanishing points.

# II. Computing transformations

Given a set of matches between images $$ A $$ and $$ B $$, we must find the transform $$ T $$ that best agrees with the matches.

![image](https://maelfabien.github.io/assets/images/vision_55.jpg)

## 1. Translation

The displacement of match $$ i $$ is $$ (x_i' - x_i, y_i' - y_i) $$ where $$ x_i' = x_i + x_t $$ and $$ y_i' = y_i + y_t $$. We want therefore to solve :

$$ (x_t, y_t) = ( \frac {1} {n} \sum_i x_i' - x_i, \frac {1} {n} \sum_i y_i' - y_i ) $$

![image](https://maelfabien.github.io/assets/images/vision_56.jpg)

We face an overdetermined system of equations, which can be solved by least squares.

$$ r_{x_i}(x_t) = x_i + x_t - x_i' $$

$$ r_{y_i}(y_t) = y_i + y_t - y_i' $$

The goal is to minimize the sum of squared residuals :

$$ C(x_t, y_t) = \sum_i (r_{x_i}(x_t)^2 + r_{y_i}(y_t)^2) $$

We can rewrite the problem in matrix form :

![image](https://maelfabien.github.io/assets/images/vision_57.jpg)

And the solution heads : $$ t = (A^T A)^{-1} Ab $$

## 2. Affine transformation

$$ \begin{pmatrix} x' \\ y' \\ w' \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} a & b & c \\ d & e & f \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \\ w \end{pmatrix} $$

We can write the residuals as :

$$ r_{x_i}(a,b,c,d,e,f) = (ax_i + by_i + c) - x_i' $$

$$ r_{y_i}(a,b,c,d,e,f) = (dy_i + ey_i + f) - y_i' $$

And rewrite the cost function as :

$$ C(a,b,c,d,e,f) = \sum_i ( r_{x_i}(a,b,c,d,e,f)^2 + r_{y_i}(a,b,c,d,e,f)^2 ) $$

Which can be rewritten in matrix form as :

![image](https://maelfabien.github.io/assets/images/vision_58.jpg)

Let's develop a more general formulation. We have $$ x' = f(x,p) $$ a parametric transformation. The Jacobian of the transformation $$ f $$ with respect to the motion parameters $$ p $$ determines the relationship between the amount of motion $$ \Delta x = x' - x $$ and the unknown parameters $$ \Delta x = x' - x = J(x)p $$ . We note that $$ J = \frac {\delta f} {\delta p} $$.

![image](https://maelfabien.github.io/assets/images/vision_59.jpg)

The sum of squared residuals is then :

$$ E_{LLS} = \sum_i {\mid \mid J(x_i)p - \Delta x_i \mid \mid_2 }^2 $$

The solution yields :

$$ Ap = b $$ where :
- we define $$ A = \sum_i J^T(x_i)J(x_i) $$ the Hessian
- and $$ b = \sum_i J^T(x_i) \Delta x_i $$

Up to now, we considered only a perfect matching accuracy. It's however only rarely the case. We can weight the least squares problem :

$$ E_{WLS} = \sum_i {\Sigma_i}^2 \mid \mid r_i \mid \mid $$ . If the $$ \delta_i $$ are fixed, the solution to apply is : $$ p = ( \sum^T A^T A \Sigma)^-1 \sigma^T Ab $$ with $$ \Sigma $$ a matix containing for each observation the noise level.
