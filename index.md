Welcome to my blog. My name is Maël and I'm a co-founder of [biped](https://biped.ai/), an AI copilot that guides blind and visually impaired people using sounds. I'm a Data Scientist by training and  previously a Ph.D. student at [Idiap Research Institute](https://www.idiap.ch/en) and [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/) in Speech Processing, on [ROXANNE European Project](https://roxanne-euproject.org/).

I love traveling, and came back from a world tour right before COVID, early 2020. I'm a plant-based sports fan (hiking, fitness, volleyball, javelin..). I love creating things, especially when it implies Machine Learning.

I have a B.Sc. in Economics and an M.Sc. in Actuarial Science both from the HEC Faculty of University of Lausanne (applied mathematics and statistics for the insurance sector). I did not really like working in this field, and did a second Master, this time in Data Science, at Telecom Paris (Institut Polytechnique de Paris, France). I was then a Ph.D. student in Speech Processing at Idiap Research Institute starting March 2020, attached to EPFL Electrical Engineering department. I co-founded biped in January 2021, and dropped out of my PhD in December 2021 to focus 100% on biped. 

I worked in several startups, especially in NLP, and I've been working as a freelance data scientist on the side of everything else for 3 years now. I started this blog in September 2018, and publish all codes and exercises of this website on GitHub in a dedicated repository:
