<p style="font-size:0.5em">Current status: Traveling in French Polynesia, writing articles, doing projects.</p>

Welcome to my blog. My name is Maël and I'm a data scientist. I am currently traveling South East Asia, New Zealand, Tahiti and Chile with my girlfriend. I’m posting some pictures of my travel in the Travel section. 

Outside of Data Science, my interests are:
- Sports: Hiking in Switzerland, running on the beach in Britanny, practicing Fitness/Crossfit. I used to play volleyball and have been Swiss national champion in Junior. I also used to (and still do sometimes) practice javelin. I won several times the Javelin Championship in Rhône-Alpes region in Junior (± 50 meters).
- Animals: I have been vegetarian for close to 4 years, love animals and support some associations.
- Reading/Learning: I spend most of my free time trying to learn stuffs. I try to do 1 online course per month, although I don't always manage to do so.
- Entrepreneurship: I launched a first startup project during my Master and got some money from an entrepreneurial contest in Lausanne. I was invited at the 2018 final of this contest to share my experience on stage.

I have a B.Sc. in Economics and an M.Sc. in Actuarial Science both from the University of Lausanne (HEC Faculty). I don’t expect many people to know what actuarial science is, but to keep it short, it’s mostly applied mathematics and statistics for the insurance sector. I worked for 6 months in an insurance company, developed a large interest in Machine Learning and programming, and joined Telecom Paris (Institut Polytechnique de Paris, France) for a Specialized Master in Data Science. I finished this degree in 2019. I will start a PhD in Speech Processing at EPFL's Idiap Lab in March 2020.

I just finished an internship as a Data Scientist at [Anasen](https://anasen.com/), a Y-Combinator startup in Paris. I previously interned at [Veamly](https://veamly.com/) in NLP. Outside of that, I'm a Machine Learning instructor at [VivaData](https://vivadata.org/), an AI Bootcamp in Paris, [Stat4Decision](https://www.stat4decision.com/en/) and [Dakar Insitute of Technology](https://dit.sn/). I also write articles about AI for [Digital Minds](https://www.digitalminds.io/), [Explorium](https://www.explorium.ai/), [Stat4Decision](https://www.stat4decision.com/en/) and on [Medium](https://medium.com/@mael.fabien). My technical interests are:
- Applied Machine Learning and Deep Learning
- Statistics in general
- Natural Language Processing
- Speech Processing
- A bit of data engineering

I started this blog in September 2018 for several reasons:
- Writing helps me understand. Pictures and schemas too. I am trying to combine both in my articles.
- I did most of my studies in English, although it's not my native language. This blog is a way to keep writing.
- Data Science is moving fast. Reading about AI-related news could be a full-time job. I learn best by doing projects. So I post most of them here.
- I forget stuff, so it's always good to have them written down in a single place.
- If this blog can help someone else, this makes my day.

You can find [here](https://maelfabien.github.io/year-archive/#) a list of all the articles I have written. You will find content related to my fields of interest :
- [Statistics and Machine Learning](https://maelfabien.github.io/ml/)
- [Deep Learning](https://maelfabien.github.io/dl/)
- [Reinforcement Learning](https://maelfabien.github.io/rl/)
- [Data Engineering](https://maelfabien.github.io/bgd/)

If you have some time ahead of you, I was recently interviewed an shared my background, my experience as a young graduate, thoughts and projects...

All codes and exercises of this website are hosted on GitHub in a dedicated repository:

You can [contact me](mailto:mael.fabien@gmail.com) if you think we could work together on an article or a project, or if you have any question/remark. If you would like to get to know more about me and my projects, feel free to check out my [resume](https://maelfabien.github.io/assets/files/CV_MF.pdf). I'm uploading on this blog articles that I'm writing in my free time. I'm trying to upload one article per week. 

I recently launched a newsletter in which I gather some articles I wrote on a topic, interesting Github repositories, projects, papers and more! If you want to stay in the loop, I'll try to send 1 email per month :)

This website gathered a little more than 40'000 unique visitors (Oct. 2019) since its creation. Where do other visitors come from?

This website is adapted from [Minimal Mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) theme for Jekyll. I have essentially modified some layout elements, the video layer, the pulsing arrow in the home page and some widgets. If you would like to use it for your own blog, feel free to fork the repository.
